Glad to see that you have installed the Projectplace Sublime test runner.. In tests we trust right!
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Before you start using the Plugin you will need to add some settings to your .sublime-project file. 
(The plugin will not work unless you have a .sublime-project file)

Add this to the file:
"settings": 
    {   
        "projectplace_test_runner": 
        {
            "root_dev_env": "<CHANGE TO YOU ROOT PREFIX",
            "domain":"<THE DOMAIN YOUR DEV ENVIRONMENT IS ON",
            "run_on_save": "1 or EMPTY"
        }
    }
"root_dev_env" will be something like ole, apr or shd. In other words, you personal dev environment prefix.

"domain" will be ".next.in-dev.projectplace.com" for Bangalore developers and ".next.dev.projectplace.com" 
for Stockholm developers. Don't forget the starting . in the url.

"run_on_save" (Optional) Add a single 1 as value and then sublime will run the associated test file when 
you save the file. Leave it empty if you do not want this, or remove the setting all together.

To run the Python unittests you can make use of the menu found when "right-click" on the file being edited. 
Search for Projectplace and run your option. The same Menu is found under "Tools>Projectplace>"
The result of the unittests will be presented in the Sublime Console, enable it by going to Sublime menu option Views>Show Console
